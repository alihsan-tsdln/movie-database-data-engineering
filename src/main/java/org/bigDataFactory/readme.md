# Starting the project
We are going on as you started Docker and servers. If you don't how to do it, [look at here](https://github.com/alihsan-tsdln/movie-database-data-engineering/blob/main/README.md)

# For start Bulk Loading
You can run the Main.java for start bulk loading. If you've done it, your data would be duplicate so be careful for you don't have these bulk loaded data in your database.

# For start the server.
You can run the Application.java for start server. You should have data on Apache Cassandra for use it properly.
